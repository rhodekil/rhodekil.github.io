<h1>Big Ol' Portfolio of Random Art</h1>

<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Big Rat</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/01.png">
	<p>A big rat I drew for my friend. Look how nasty this guy is!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Red Album Cover With Yelling Dog</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/02.png">
	<p>This is an album cover for a self-titled album by Vndervvhelmer, which is the name I will release music under when I actually make something good. There are a lot of random Vndervvhelmer mockups in this portfolio, so strap in!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Jizz City Bastards</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/03.png">
	<p>A vector logo I designed for my fantasy football team, the Jizz City Bastards. I have no idea how to do fantasy football by the way.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Crazy Name Vector</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/04.png">
	<p>Check out this cool, stylish metal-esque logo. I'll do this for your band name! Or your actual name! Or any word! Or series of words! Length permitting of course!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Lawnmower</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/05.png">
	<p>If you'd prefer a more traditional metal logo, I can do those too. This is an example of one of those, with the word lawnmower.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">My Favorite Animal Is a Deer</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/06.png">
	<p>By the end of this portfolio, you will never want to see another digitally edited deer skull in your life.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Palace of Fractal Flesh & the Machine</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/07.png">
	<p>This is an album cover I made but never used for my weird little music project, <a href="http://slimepoetry.bandcamp.com">Don't the Ghost</a>.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Be Very Awake</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/08.png">
	<p>It took me a very long time to make enough money for this image! Get it? Because of the one hundred dollar bills.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Welcome to the Fire Pit</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/09.png">
	<p>This is another Don't the Ghost album cover, but this one actually got released. Check it out <a href="http://slimepoetry.bandcamp.com/album/welcome-to-the-fire-pit">right here</a> if ya want!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Bad Bitch International</h3>

	<p>This could be you!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Ace of Holes</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/11.png">
	<p>A while back, I was working on a Rhode Kil tarot deck. The project is on hiatus for the moment, but I figured I'd throw in some of the cards cuz I like the art!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Ace of Nails</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/12.png">
	<p>Here's another tarot card. That's gotta hurt!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Doesn't Resonate</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/13.png">
	<p>This is the cover for an album I made where the lyrics were written pretty much entirely by a neural network. It's fun stuff! I never 'officially' released it, but as a special treat for looking at my portfolio, check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hItoLkBq3ZE">over here</a>!</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Now We Are All Sons of Bitches</h3>

	<p>Nuclear bombs will do that to ya.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">GUNG GUNG</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/15.png">
	<p>This is an album cover I made for GUNG GUNG. What's GUNG GUNG? Wait and see.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Balancing My Own Eyes</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/16.png">

</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Meat Queen</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/17.png">
	<p>If you let me do album art for you, I'll be your meat queen forever.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Rainbow Thing With Stuff</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/18.png">
	<p>It's exactly what it sounds like.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">MMXVIII</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/19.png">
	<p>This was a <a href="https://slimepoetry.bandcamp.com/album/mmxviii-single">Don't the Ghost single</a> that I released for the New Year. It was on January 3rd, though.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Glitchy Baby God</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/20.png">
	<p>I don't make as much glitch art as I used to, but I am always happy to create some fun digital chaos.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Fuck What You Heard, Everything Still Sucks</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/21.png">
	<p>Old unreleased album. I dunno why the image quality went to shit, but the idea is there. ;-]</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Psychedelic Goats</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/22.png">

</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">Touching the Robot</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/25.png">
	<p>Neither Funny Jokes nor Touching the Robot are actual things. Just a fun mockup album cover. Also, I love teeth. Probably my second favorite thing behind deer skulls.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="stupid">
	<h3 class="t">hey, i don't feel great at the moment</h3>
	<img class="i" src="i/26.png">
